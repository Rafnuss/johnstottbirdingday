        "body":"<p>My main recollection of John was that he would wake very early to work on one of his books and had probably done three hours before breakfast. For one of his afternoon horizontal half-hours he slept on the ground on a Turkish hillside. Barbara and I were supposed to be keeping an eye on him but inevitably wandered off quite far. We were horrified to look back with our binoculars and see a shepherd poking him with a stick to see if he was alive. When we got back John was getting on well with the shepherd, discussing the price of wool or some such thing, even though he could not speak a word of Turkish, and the Turk had no English.</p><p>In the Pyrenees we seemed to spend an awful lot of time fruitlessly searching cliff faces for Wall Creepers without success - but we had great walks in wonderful habitats.</p>",

        "body":"<p>Uncle John made a couple of visits to Uganda when I was living there in the late 1990s and so I had the pleasure of joining him for some birdwatching when he had completed his speaking duties. On the first occasion we had a memorable trip to Murchison Falls National Park in the company of David Zac Niringiye, and Uncle John’s study assistant Corey Widmer. I was determined to show them one of my favourite spectacles – the feasting by birds of prey on a great host of bats emerging at dusk from their roost in the cliff below the waterfall. The best views could only be had by hopping the very modest fence so you could peer over the cliff edge. Uncle John was not going to do anything other than encourage his young and rather unthinking guide, and so we cleared the fence and got ourselves into position to enjoy the sunset and wait for the bats. As ever, they didn’t disappoint. Huge numbers streamed out of their cave below and up into the air above the mist from the falls. And as they came out so did the African Hobbys, the Yellow-billed Kites, the African Fish Eagles and the star of the show, the Bat Hawk. The bats were so thick that it seemed the birds only had to trawl through the mass with their legs hanging down to have a chance of catching hold of one. By the time the show was over the sun was well below the horizon and, as always seems remarkable for a high latitude visitor to the equator, it had grown dark remarkably quickly. It was then that we discovered that Uncle John’s eyesight, no longer at its best in his nearly 80 years, was not only a challenge for picking out a fleeting bird in a forest canopy, but also for seeing very much at all when the light was low. And now we had a cliff top to navigate, a fence to climb over, and a rocky and uneven footpath back through the darkly shaded riverside forest. And with no torch between us. We did of course find our way out but only by a combination of very slow progress and with Uncle John walking behind me, both his hands on my shoulders and moving his feet in time with me to place them where I placed mine. I don’t recall him referring us to John 21:18 but he might have been thinking it, not least because that same morning had involved a rather hilarious incident concerning his trousers, but that’s a story for another time. Corey and Zac are my witnesses.</p>",

        "body":"<p>It is difficult to choose one picture from birding with John all over the world, usually on the back of his and our work travels. It was usually a new A Rocha project or some speaking that took us there, but sometimes we and some friends just went. On this occasion it was to find wintering Red-breasted Geese in the Danube Delta, hosted on a rather shaky craft in mostly freezing fog by our piratical friend, second from the left. Despite the predations of many Italian hunters we did see the geese, although quite typically John’s ruthless honesty was correct in saying it was a brief and perhaps not altogether satisfactory distant view. However our week together, organised by Paul Jeanson on the left, and Mihai Ciopasiu on the right, with Barbara and Richard Mearns and Colin Jackson, was truly memorable, not least for five species of woodpecker including Grey-headed.</p>",

He was fatigued from days of travel and speaking, but, even in his mid-80’s was looking forward to a day off to view water fowl at the beach.</p><p>He was at a point that, when walking together, I would take one elbow and the Study Assistant would take the other. We crested the top of a dune and suddenly Uncle John broke into a fast walk! He looked over his shoulder at me and called out: “Keep up with me boys!”</p><p>I love this memory of his joy and vigor. And, it reminds me that, to this day, I am always encouraged to “keep up with him” in so many different ways.",

        "body": "<p>Like many new Christians I had thoroughly enjoyed the thoughtful argument of John Stott’s books, but had never really expected to meet him. However, in June 1996, whilst Helen and I were living in Eugene, Oregon, Peter and Miranda Harris stayed with for 10 days, and brought John to join them for a week of that. We learnt of his great quest – to photograph Snowy Owls on breeding territory in Arctic Canada – an ambition which he was to fulfil on leaving us. But before he went, we did our best to show him some of Oregon’s great birding with the help of my good friend Tom Mickel. We shared astounding views of Spotted Owl in old growth forest, as well as male Harlequin Duck and Black Swift at Davis Lake in the Cascades; I recall too that John took special pleasure in watching Lewis’ Woodpeckers nesting on the edge of a burnt area of forest. It was a huge honour to spend time with him, and to experience his great humility.</p>",

        "body": "<p>A Rocha Lebanon had been going for two years when John Stott came to visit in May 1996. The prime reason for the visit was to speak at an evangelical conference on the environment in Beirut – a landmark not just because it dealt with the gospel and creation care but because it managed to bring together a wide range of churches in a notoriously divided country. </p><p>But John of course wanted to do some bird watching, including seeing the focus of A Rocha Lebanon’s labours: the Aammiq wetland in the southern part of the Bekaa. As Chairman of A Rocha Lebanon and someone with a lot of responsibility for coordinating events, I had the honour of driving him over to the wetland. I don’t think I’ve ever been quite so careful driving on the lethal road up over the great ridge of Mount Lebanon. In between watching out for lorries with failed brakes, the open manholes and the meandering Syrian military vehicles I found myself during my best to explain the impossible complexities of contemporary Lebanon to John who, in his usual gentlemanly manner took it all in and responded with the sort of questions that demanded a lot of thought. Eventually we made it over the ridge and started to drive south down the Bekaa. I gestured to one of the Palestinian military encampments we passed and made the confident assertion that the while the Israelis used to bomb them in the past they didn’t do it anymore. John was clearly impressed by my military knowledge but less so when five minutes later in the untidy village of Qabb Elias we were told that the Israelis had bombed the camp overnight.</p><p>With my reputation as any sort of reliable font of knowledge now in irremediable tatters we drove on past the line of Syrian armour to the wetland and there birding – and in John’s case, bird photography  – began as, gradually, other people arrived.  I would love to say exactly what we watched (a note against one of these photographs says that we saw pelicans) but here my coordinator role took over and I found myself constantly keeping an eye on my watch and eventually trying to make the point, as graciously as possible, that we really ought to head back. But I can say that John – who had been so influential in getting A Rocha going – thoroughly enjoyed himself and took enormous pleasure in seeing Christian conservation in action.</p><p>I must add however a slight sad postscript to John’s time in Lebanon. A few days later after a very successful conference in Beirut, John was out birding again in the Bekaa. Teaching kept me in the American University but I heard the account of what happened. At some point in the hot day John had looked in puzzlement at his binoculars and then handed them to someone else saying ‘Can you adjust them for me? They don’t seem to be focusing.’ The binoculars were scrutinised and then returned to him with a troubled enquiry ‘Err, there’s nothing wrong with them John: are you all right?’ Clearly he wasn’t . John was hastily returned to Beirut and returned to London immediately where he was met on landing by a doctor.  I never heard the diagnosis – why should I? – but I believe it marked the start of the fading health of his later years. So, I ask myself, was that day at the Aammiq Wetland one of his last really well birding days? I don’t know. If it was, it was appropriate. After all, in his long years of guidance and encouragement, John had played a key part in saving it.",

It was a wetland area, and he spied some green shanks feeding along the shore, but after a few minutes he said “listen, I think there is a red shank in amongst them.”  And sure enough, one of the birds was a red shank.  I was amazed at his skill and concentration.</p>",

        "body": "<p>It was a unique day and experience for me. President of our Church, brother Dr Pavel Černý, a spiritual disciple of John Stott, asked me to organise a one-day trip with John Stott to the pond basin of southern Bohemia. John was lecturing at a several-day theological conference in Prague. They decided to see us in southern Bohemia and visit the Velký and Malý Tisý bird sanctuaries. Then, I used to visit the oldest Czech ornithological station, either alone or with our afterschool club children, and I suspected with fear that the November date would not be very rich in birds. John arrived from Prague by car with his friend Pavel Černý, who was wearing a fixation collar around his neck after a serious car accident. The chairman and secretary of ČSO (Czech Ornithological Society), dr. Formánek and dr. Škopek came as well. After stretching two nets, we went into the field. We were able to make some quite common observations of White tailed Eagle, several species of waders and ducks, and Great White Egret and Gray Herons. John Stott rejoiced in every observation, even though they were common to us. He asked curiously about many things and shared with us some concerns about the negative trends in population development in this area, which was especially due to the extreme growth of fishing industry. We got back to the station quite tired.</p><p>After eating a great refreshment from my wife Radka, we needed to digest a bit, and John made a request to rest for an hour. We let him have a nap on the only bed in the corner of the research station (there is a modest dormitory for more people in the loft of the station). Since then, we've called it “John Stott's holy bed.” Whenever I lie down on it, I always remember John with gratitude. Even as Protestants, we can have our 'saints' and associated relics. This bed is one of them. After having a rest, John showed a keen interest in another field trip again.</p><p>At that moment, we were informed about a significant 'catch' of little birds flying in the surrounding. There were almost thirty Long-tailed tits in the net, Willou Tit  and Tree Creeper. John rejoiced at the colourful Long taied Tit of both the europaeus and caudatus varieties, looking enthusiastically at the Tree Creeper and the Willou Tit. It took us over an hour to ring all of them, John was excited and looked at all the details on the birds´ feathers with great interest. ... As a token of his gratitude for organizing the day and accompanying him, I received from him a Czech edition of his commentary to the Epistle  to the Ephesian  with a personal dedication. And later beautiful ringing pliers came from England. He had noticed our home-made primitive ringing tools. Later, we exchanged a few letters about a certain North American species of spotted woodpecker, and I also received an atlas of North American birds from him. Our brother John was so attentive and helpful. After all, he was certainly very busy, with many large and important conferences, writing books, preaching, but he was able to encourage individuals or a small group. And most importantly, he was able to spare some time for birdwatching during a theological conference. It was his strong desire and great joy .... and love. I believe that today he would also rejoice about A Rocha Czech and its efforts. Its origins came about a year after his visit to the Velký Tisý pond, in the picturesque landscape of hundreds of lakes and ponds.</p>",
