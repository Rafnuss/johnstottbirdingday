The website is build by [@rafnuss](https://github.com/Rafnuss) and [@dannolloth](https://github.com/dannolloth) based on [Boostrap 5.0](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap), and [Leaflet.js](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet). We also used [eBird](https://ebird.org/) for collecting the birding data and [eBird API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/664302/S1ENwy59?version=latest) to display them on the website.
